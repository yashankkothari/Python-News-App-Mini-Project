# Python-News-App-Mini-Project
News App i created using python for my college mini project

# How it works

1. The code uses the News API to fetch news articles based on user input.
2. It creates a GUI using the Tkinter library to provide a user interface for searching and displaying news.
3. The user can enter a search query in the input field and click the "SEARCH" button.
4. The code validates the input and sends a request to the News API to fetch relevant articles.
5. If articles are found, the code extracts the title, description, and URL of the top 3 articles.
6. The extracted information is displayed in the output text area of the GUI.
7. The user has the option to send the news articles via email.
8. If the user chooses to send via email, a dialog prompts them to enter their email address.
9. The code then sends an email with the news articles as the content.
10. If any error occurs during the email sending process, an error message is displayed.
11. The GUI provides a visually appealing interface for the user to interact with the news app.
